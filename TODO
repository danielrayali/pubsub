- Create common server interface boilerplate
- Synchronize subscribers list for multiple threads
- Write a component test to run master_server and ensure query_client get good results
- Implement RemoveTopic() in master_client
- Write a component test to shutdown topic_server when there are subscribers connected for a clean break
- Write a component test to run topic_server, attach multiple subscribers, send multiple publisher messages, ensure messages are received, and everything shuts down gracefully
- Added exception handling to each *_main.cc file
- Have topic_server update subscriber list when a client closes a connection or it can't send to that client
- When MasterServer calls Configure() remove existing topic servers and potentially restart the acceptor on a new master port
- Ensure proper shutdown of all topic servers from the master server (currently timing out)
- Figure out how to properly move all members of TopicServer (instead of using heap)
